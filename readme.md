## Loan Calculator

This program takes the basic terms of a loan (amount borrowed, fixed APR%, duration of the loan) and calculates the monthly payment needed to pay of the loan in time. It also takes a value called epsilon which determines the accuracy of the calculation. In other words this monthly payment will take the balance to zero +- epsilon.

The program makes use of a hi/low guessing algorthm to pinpoint the monthly payment need. As interest needs to be calculated monthly before each payment is made, the total balance to be pay=id off shifts in two directions: down because of the payment, but also up because of the added interest.

I hope you enjoy the program. It has given me some drive to pay off my student loans a little more quickly.
